# Sennet
A simpler way to use pentesting tools! Sennet is a group of commands that takes things like NMAP, aircrack-ng, and more all into simpler and faster commands to use!
This is a great repo for newer pentesters and veterans alike! Feel free to leave your thoughts, comments, or suggestions!

# Install

Run the following commands to install Sennet:

```
git clone https://github.com/Preeby/Sennet/
cd Sennet
chmod +X install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The install script should do everything automatically, if not tell me!
